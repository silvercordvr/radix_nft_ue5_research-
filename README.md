Here's the translated and formatted version of your text for a **GitHub README** with added links to relevant resources:

## **Proposed Project Architecture**

### **1. Client-Side (Unreal Engine):**

- Game logic.
- Interface for Radex integration (e.g., NFT purchase menu).
- WebSocket connection to the server.

### **2. Server-Side:**

- Player authentication.
- NFT transaction verification.
- Linking player accounts with their wallets.

- Blockchain integration:
    - Wallet support.
    - NFT contracts on the selected platform.
    - Smart contracts for purchases and exchanges.

## **Why is a Dedicated Server Required for NFT Transactions?**

Theoretically, Unreal Engine can handle player authentication and basic wallet linking if plugins and blockchain tools are integrated. However, for a project designed for 10,000+ players, **Unreal Engine alone is insufficient** to manage all aspects of the game, including blockchain functionalities and wallet interactions. Here are the main reasons:

---

### **1. Unreal Engine Server Limitations**

Unreal Engine servers are optimized for gaming tasks such as:
- Synchronizing in-game events between players.
- Processing network interactions (replication, RPC).
- Managing the game world and physics.

However:
- **Not optimized for scalability**: Unreal Engine servers struggle with atypical workloads like blockchain API calls or authentication handling.
- **Difficult to scale**: Supporting tens of thousands of players requires creating multiple server instances and managing load balancing.

---

### **2. Scalability and Load Management**

For 10,000+ players, you will need:
- **A scalable architecture** where game servers and business logic servers (authentication, transactions, blockchain interaction) are separate.
- **Load balancing** using proxies like NGINX or AWS Elastic Load Balancer.

Unreal Engine servers cannot independently manage the distribution of load across tens of thousands of connections effectively.

---

### **3. Security**

For a large-scale project, it is crucial to:
- Securely handle user data, including wallets and transactions.
- Use specialized servers for key and blockchain operations.

Unreal Engine servers do not provide the required level of security for storing and processing such sensitive data.

---

### **4. Recommended Architecture for a Large-Scale Project**

To support 10,000+ players, a **segmented architecture** is required:

1. **Game Servers:**
   - Unreal Engine Dedicated Servers to handle only game logic.
   - One Unreal Engine server can support 50â€“100 players per instance (depending on game complexity). For 10,000 players, a cluster of servers will be required.

2. **Business Logic Server:**
   - **Node.js** or **Python (FastAPI)** servers to handle:
     - Player authentication.
     - Wallet linking.
     - Blockchain interaction.
     - Storing player data.

3. **Database:**
   - Relational databases (e.g., **PostgreSQL**) to store player profiles.
   - NoSQL databases (e.g., **MongoDB**) for dynamic data related to NFTs.

4. **Load Balancing:**
   - **NGINX** or cloud solutions like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

5. **Blockchain Interaction:**
   - [Radix JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/radixdlt) for connecting the Node.js application to the Radix network.
   - [Radix Wallet](https://wallet.radixdlt.com) for cryptocurrency and NFT management.

---

### **5. Example Data Flow**

1. **Player connects to the UE server:**
   - The game server verifies the player's connection and synchronizes the game session.

2. **Player purchases an NFT:**
   - The game server sends a request to the business logic server.
   - The business logic server interacts with the player's wallet via the blockchain API.
   - After a successful transaction, data is sent back to the UE server.

3. **Scalability:**
   - Additional game servers are automatically added to the cluster.
   - Blockchain requests are processed asynchronously on the business logic server.

---

### **6. Task Segmentation**

Separating game logic and blockchain functions allows for:
- Efficient scaling of servers for thousands of players.
- Reducing the impact of blockchain operations on the game process.
- Simplifying updates to components (game server or business logic).

---

### **Conclusion**

For a project with 10,000+ players, using only an Unreal Engine server is **insufficient**. A dedicated server for authentication, wallet linking, and NFT processing is required. This will ensure scalability, security, and stable operation.

## **Technologies New to the Team**

NFT and Blockchain are new areas for our team. However, after studying the documentation and examples, we concluded that these are well-established mechanisms for user interaction. With the right tools, we can quickly integrate NFT asset management into the game process.

---

## **Proposed Workflow**

We offer 30 hours of weekly development time, covering:
- Game development.
- Server logic setup.
- API and cloud server configuration.

However, we would need to review deadlines for each task and adjust them as needed. As this is a unique stack, there may be unexpected challenges or compatibility issues at some stages. On the other hand, certain tasks might be completed faster than anticipated, allowing us to allocate saved time to more complex objectives.
